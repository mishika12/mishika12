Hi, I’m Mishika. Welcome to my Github portal.

#### 👩‍🎓 About Me 

Looking for a problem solver with a penchant for driving data-driven business decisions? Well, look no further because that is where I come in! 

With a robust academic background in the quantitative discipline of Economics and over 3 years of experience in strategy consulting across industry domains, my love for leveraging data to derive actionable business insights led me to "shift gears" and pursue my Master’s in Business Analytics at UCLA Anderson School of Management.

My prior experience of working in the Venture Ecosystem team at Bain & Company enabled me to help Fortune 500 clients with critical insights on the innovation disruption in the startup and venture capital domain using predictive modeling and visualization. What's even more rewarding is the lasting relationships I've built with clients across various sectors including retail, technology, finance, and construction.

I am interested to apply and engage in an internship role that lies at the intersection of business strategy, product development and data science/ analytics. Please feel free to reach out to me at: mishika.ms.2024@anderson.ucla.edu
